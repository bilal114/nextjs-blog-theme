        through Gerald Wallet. <br />
        <br />
        We work with vendors to enable them to accept payments from you using Gerald Wallet. In doing so, a vendor may
        share information about you with us, such as your mobile phone number, email address, or Gerald Wallet username,
        when you attempt to pay that vendor. We use this information to confirm to that vendor that you are a Gerald
        Wallet customer and that the vendor should enable Gerald Wallet as a form of payment for your purchase.
        <br />
        <br />
        Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid through

                For the purposes of this privacy policy, an "account connection" with such a third party is a connection
                you authorize or enable between your Gerald Wallet account and a non-Gerald account, payment instrument,
                or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you authorize such a connection, Gerald and the
                third-party will exchange your personal information and other information directly. Examples of account
                connections include, without limitation: linking your Gerald Wallet account to a social media account or
                social messaging service; connecting your Gerald Wallet account to a third-party data aggregation or
                financial services company, if you provide such company with your Gerald Wallet account log-in
                credentials; or using your Gerald Wallet account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant

                If you connect your Gerald Wallet account to other financial or insurance accounts, directly or through
                a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and account and transactional
                information, such as purchases and funds transfers. If you choose to create an account connection, we
                may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-partys service. For
                example, if you connect your Gerald Wallet account to a social media account, we will receive personal
                information from the social media provider via the account connection. We will use all such information
                that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this privacy

                should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your personal information
                as part of the account connection. For example, personal information that Gerald shares with a
                third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other
                parties, including the general public, depending on the accounts or platforms privacy practices.

        Gerald does not send your personal information to third-party social networks unless you have specifically

        information that we collect with them. Our Service may also include features from third parties that allow you
        to interact with other online services, including social media. For example, we may use third parties to allow
        you to send messages, tweets, or make postings on social media sites, like Facebook. If you use these features,
        then we may share information about you with those third parties, and they may collect additional information.

        <br />
        Third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of
        information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites. This Policy does not apply
        to these third-party technologies because we may not control them and we are not responsible for them. Do Not
