              <span>Huge opportunity.</span> About a third of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and are struggling to
              pay their bills on time. About 100 million Americans are at risk of paying overdraft fees if they auto-pay
              their bills. We have the ability to help a lot of people profitably.

              <span> A great team.</span> Our founding team has deep expertise in financial services, product
              engineering, data science, and machine learning, as well as degrees from MIT, Harvard, Columbia,
              Georgetown, and Yale. We try to take a scientific, data-driven approach whenever possible.

              <span>Challenging problems.</span> With every single customer that we onboard, it means we are dealing
              with millions of data records. The challenge is to scale up the product to handle so much data and process
              it efficiently, while taking all measures to ensure the security of the data. The goal is to make our
              system learn as quickly as possible so that it can give very accurate predictions when making suggestions
              related to consumers.

                <span> Culture.</span> Having worked at high growth, early stage startups in the past, our team
                understands the value of work-life balance. We take weekends off and go on paid vacations.

                Combinator and other top tier investors. We keep a lean team, and this is a rare opportunity to join us
                - you'll learn a lot, build cool products, and grow as our company scales!

          Most of our team members are from the Engineering domain. We are a global company with members of both the
          Data Science and Engineering teams located across the world, from India to Nigeria and from Europe to the US.
          <br />
          We are an agile team and run weekly sprints. We ship code daily, and each deployment goes through a couple of
          stages after the engineer submits a Pull Request (PR). We have a PR workflow on GitHub and once the PR is
          approved it goes through our CI/CD workflow where the software is built & tested and if everything works fine,
          it is deployed to our staging servers on AWS automatically. Once tested on staging servers, the deployment is
          pushed to production.

            Our team is all about having a growth mindset and helping each other recognize and develop it further. We
            continuously encourage our peers to see what they can learn from a situation.
            <br /><br />
            We love it when our team members are experimental in their approach at work and choose not to go ahead with
            a gut feeling, rather test out different approaches and let the results/data/metrics speak for themselves.
            We know that sometimes we might fail as well, but that does not make us afraid to experiment. We want all of
            our team members to enjoy their journey of learning with us and not be driven only by making everything
            around them successful - we want to be a part of each team member's journey with us as they experience
            growth along the way.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have a heavy cross team collaboration and value the team's feedback. We do not practice top-down
            accountability - even our CEO is as accountable to the rest of the team as we are to each other. Our team
            believes in having a high critical thinking ability, as this enables us to make decisions very quickly.

            <p>
              Earlier this year, one of our employees went on a full 1-month paid vacation - with a strict DO NOT WORK
              during this period instruction. :)

            <p>
              Since we have team members from different time-zones working with us, it matters to us that the work is
              done rather than focusing on the number of hours clocked. You have the flexibility to choose what hours in
              a day work, with exceptions such as: daily stand up calls and team meetings.

              We are a fully remote working team. We plan on opening up offices in several locations across the 4
