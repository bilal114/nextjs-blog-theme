                    Bill Tracking - Paperless billing is great, but it can sometimes be hard to keep track of where all
                    of your bills are and where your money is going. Gerald puts all of your bills in one place. You can
                    cancel subscriptions you don’t use, switch bill payments to different accounts, set up autopay, and
                    get control of your bills once and for all.

                    Cash Advances - When you link your account and income to Gerald, you can get simple, easy cash

                    unexpected expenses or bills that you can’t quite cover.
