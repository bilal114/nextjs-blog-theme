              <br />

              bill payment. Not only will Gerald make sure that your bills are paid on time, but it can also help you
              pay them too. Learn more about our bill pay service platform below and find out how it can make you more

          <h2 class="section__title">How It Works</h2>
          <p class="section__subtitle">
            The way Gerald works is simple. First, you sign up for an account. Then you just need to link your billing
            accounts and your bank. This will put our bill pay features in action. With just this information, Gerald
            will provide you with notifications for upcoming payments and alert you when your account is low. If you
            provide Gerald with employment data as well, you can get money instantly to pay your bills when you’re
            running a little short. Here are your options:

                  <img src="./images/dot.svg" alt="Dot" />
                  <p>Instantly get a cash advance of $215. We’ve got you covered.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="solution__list__item">
                  <img src="./images/dot.svg" alt="Dot" />
                  <p>Get up to half your paycheck early.</p>

            Your bill payments are already hard enough to keep track of. Adding on the stress of not being able to pay
            on time can make every billing cycle miserable. Instead of putting up with the hassle, let Gerald take care
            of everything and take your mind off of billing for once.

          <h2 class="section__title">How To Set Up Your Schedule</h2>
          <p class="section__subtitle">
            Setting up your bill payment schedule is simple and intuitive. All you need to do is enter your billing
            accounts and Gerald will take care of the rest. Gerald will track your due dates for all your bills, learn
            your bill payments, let you know about upcoming bills, and help you pay them.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can easily adjust your schedule if need be. You can even set up automatic payments or recurring payments
            if you’re wanting to pay down a credit card bill throughout the month. Gerald lets you customize your
            schedule in a way that works for you.

            You can pay your bills easily by linking your bank account. You can also open an FDIC-insured account
            through Gerald and pay your bills through there. Having an account with Gerald lets you earn cash back and
            rewards, in addition to never missing those pesky bills again. It’s also easy to withdraw or deposit your
            money at any time.

            If you want to set your own reminders, you can easily do that. Or you can have Gerald set them based on your
            upcoming bills. Whatever reminder schedule works for you works for us. We can send you reminders a day ahead
            of time, a week ahead of time, and when the payment goes through. If you want text notifications, app
            notifications, or email notifications, we can make that happen too.
