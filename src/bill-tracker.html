          <p class="section__subtitle">
            Our advanced bill tracker keeps track of your upcoming bills so you don’t have to. All you have to do is
            link your accounts and let Gerald do its magic. Gerald will be able to find all of your bills and
            consolidate them into one convenient location. You’ll be able to see an overview of your bills, so you know
            exactly how much you owe each month.
            <br />
            <br />
            Gerald is able to find each and every bill you owe, so it can probably even find some subscriptions you
            forgot about. With Gerald, no bills will slip through the cracks. You’ll have a full and complete picture of
            what’s going on.

          <p class="section__subtitle">
            If you have multiple accounts and credit cards, it can be hard to know where your expenses are coming from.
            With Gerald, it doesn’t matter which expense is being charged where. You’ll be able to find it in our app.
            <br />
            <br />
            No more guesswork trying to remember which card you set up a subscription through. You can just check Gerald
            and find out instantly. There’s enough going on in your daily life that you shouldn’t have to be thinking
            about bills day in and day out. Instead, let Gerald do the worrying for you.

              Everyone dreads missing a bill payment. Missing a payment can lead to late fees, which means you end up
              paying more than you should. Even worse, if a bill goes through and you don’t have the money, you could
              get overdraft fees on top of late fees.
            </p>
            <p class="section__subtitle">
              What’s even worse than that is forgetting about a bill completely and it getting sent to collections
              eventually. When your missed bills get sent to collections, that can drastically alter your credit score
              for the worse.
            </p>
            <p class="section__subtitle">
              You can avoid all of these undesirable results by using Gerald. Gerald makes sure to alert you when a bill
              is coming up, let you know when you don’t have enough in your account to pay it, and even give you options
              for covering your bill when you’re a little short. Gerald can spot you $215 instantly or send you up to
              half of your paycheck early.
            </p>
            <p class="section__subtitle">
              Also, Gerald can provide you with overdraft protection when you open an account with us. Our FDIC-insured
              account will make it even easier to pay your bills, keep track of your money, and get rewards that you can
              use later. With Gerald, you can have the ultimate financial peace of mind.

              By having a clear picture of discretionary spending you’ll be far more likely to build the habit of
              keeping to your monthly budget. <br />
              Household bills are an essential part of life, and having a <span>monthly bill tracker</span> to keep
              track of bills allows for the separation of essential spending from discretionary expenses.
