        This Gerald Terms of Use (this &quot;Agreement&quot;) is provided by Gerald Technologies, Inc.
        (&quot;Gerald,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;), and governs your use of our App and
        Services.
        <span class="underline"
          >THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES AND A WAIVER OF
          YOUR CLASS ACTION RIGHTS.</span
        >
        Please read this Agreement carefully before using our services (the &quot;Services&quot;) provided through our
        Gerald App available in the Apple App Store and on Google Play (the &quot;App&quot;). In the future, we may
        decide to make the Services available through the Gerald Website located at
        <a href="https://joingerald.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://joingerald.com</a> (the
        &quot;Website&quot;), in which case, if you access the Services through the Website, then all references to
        &quot;App&quot; in this Agreement include the Gerald Website. This Agreement is between Gerald and you, the
        user. By installing, accessing or using the Services or the App and by accepting this Agreement electronically
        (for example, clicking “I Agree”), you agree to be bound by this Agreement, as this Agreement is updated from
        time to time by us. If you do not agree to this Agreement, then you may not use the Services or the App. Your
        use of the App is subject to the additional disclaimers and notices that may appear throughout the App.
        <h1 class="section__title">2. Enrollment for Gerald&#39;s Services</h1>
        In order to enroll for the Services, you will need to sign up for an account with Gerald on the App. This
        process will include creation of a login ID and password to access the Services. We may verify your identity.
        You authorize us to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity, including, if requested,
        your name, address, date of birth, government issued identification, social security number and/or requiring you
        to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address and mobile phone number, or verifying information you
        provide against third party databases or through other sources. If you do not provide this information or Gerald
        cannot verify your identity, we can refuse to allow you to use the Services and the App. You will also need to
        provide information regarding an external bank account that you maintain (the &quot;Funding Account&quot;) so
        that the account can be linked for purposes of paying Gerald&#39;s monthly membership fee and repayment of the
        Advances as described below. You further represent that you are a legal owner of, and that you are authorized to
        provide us with, that information. If any of that information changes (including your e-mail address or mobile
        phone number), you will update that information on the App as soon as possible. Should you believe or have
        reason to believe that any information you provide to us or your login credentials for your account with us has
        been compromised, or that another person is accessing your account through some other means, you agree to notify
        us as soon as possible at <b><a href="mailto:support@joingerald.com">support@joingerald.com</a></b
        >.
        <h1 class="section__title">3. Description of Gerald's Services</h1>
        3.1 <b class="underline">Piermont Bank Account and Card</b> ; Functionality. Gerald has established a
        relationship with Piermont Bank, Member FDIC ("Piermont Bank"). When you enroll and are approved for Gerald's
        Services, you will also establish a bank account at Piermont Bank (the "Account") and you will receive a
        MasterCard® virtual debit card issued by Piermont Bank (the "Card"). The Account and the Card are provided and
        issued by Piermont Bank and are described in more detail below. The terms and conditions applicable to your use
        of the Account and the Card are set forth in the [Account Agreement] between you and Piermont Bank, which is
        available at <b><a href="/deposit-agreement"> (the "Account Agreement")</a></b
        >. Subject to the Account Agreement, you may use the App to access, use, and manage your Account to transfer
        funds between accounts at Piermont Bank, transfer funds to or from accounts at other financial institutions,
        make bill payments, receive banking alerts, dispute transactions, communicate with us, and update your profile
        information. This functionality necessarily involves electronically transmitting personal financial information
        across the networks of your wireless telecommunications provider. Because neither Piermont Bank nor Gerald
        operates or controls those wireless networks, neither of us guarantee the privacy or security of wireless data
        transmissions. For mobile devices, the browser generally is pre-configured by your wireless telecommunications
        provider so you should understand their privacy and security practices

        <br />
        <br />

        3.2 <b class="underline">Bill Pay Tracking</b> . Gerald will track and manage your bill payments for biller
        accounts (such as utility companies, cell phone providers, etc.) that you connect on the App. You will provide
        credentials to your billers, and through Gerald's integration and proprietary technology, Gerald will access
        your biller account to monitor due dates and payments, provide updates to you regarding upcoming payments, and
        update the biller's account with either your Account or Card information so that your household bill payments
        can be made.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may direct Gerald to retrieve your bank account transaction history, balance information, and/or other
        information maintained by third-parties with which you have relationships, maintain accounts or engage in
        financial transactions (“Third-Party Account Information”). This may include information maintained by your
        depository institution. Gerald works with one or more third-party service providers to access this Third-Party
        Account Information. Gerald will analyze and monitor your Third-Party Account Information, and based upon
        analytics, Gerald will attempt to identify bill payments for biller accounts you have linked to your account
        with us. You authorize Gerald to access this information maintained by identified third parties, on your behalf
        as your agent, and you expressly authorize such third parties to disclose your information to us. You are
        responsible for keeping any passwords and usernames you provide to us so we can retrieve this Third-Party
        Account Information secure, and for keeping those passwords and usernames up-to-date in your account with us.
        With the exception of information related to your Card and Account, Gerald does not review the Third-Party
        Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement, and Gerald is not responsible for your
        Third-Party Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites. You acknowledge
        that any Third-Party Account Information that is displayed through the Services will be the information we most
        recently accessed, and that this information may not reflect pending transactions or other recent activity.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not set the terms of any payment transaction between you and billers, endorse or have any liability for
        transactions between you and billers, or control or have any liability for returns, refunds, or other questions
        or disputes you may have with any biller related to any payment transaction. We are not responsible for any late
        payment on any of your bills or fees associated therewith. Your biller may charge you fees for payments made
        using certain modes of payments. We are not responsible for determining your mode of payment, and we are not
        responsible for those fees. Those fees remain your responsibility.
        <br />
        <br />

        3.3 <b class="underline"> Overdraft Feature of Account.</b> If you are eligible, you may pay your bills through
        the Account's overdraft feature, which is provided to you by Piermont Bank and subject to the terms of the
        Account Agreement. To be eligible, you must have a history of at least 3 months of income deposited into the
        Funding Account, and your income must be enough to cover the expenses being linked. Additional eligibility
        requirements for the overdraft feature may be set forth in the Account Agreement or disclosed to you on the App.
        <br />
        <br />
        The overdraft feature enables you to pay for your household bills. As stated above, we will update your biller's
        account with either your Account or Card information and, if through the App you choose to use the overdraft
        feature to pay a household bill, the bill will be paid through an advance (each, an “Advance”) from Piermont
        Bank. The Advance is an overdraft on your Account. The maximum amount of the outstanding Advances at any time
        will be displayed to you on the App. We reserve the right to decline a payment if we suspect fraud, illegal
        activity or other misuse of the Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to use the overdraft feature, on the App you will be required to select a repayment date for each
        Advance. You authorize Piermont Bank (or Gerald on their behalf) to electronically initiate debits to your
        Funding Account on each repayment date. Piermont Bank (or Gerald on their behalf) will debit your Funding
        Account on each repayment date for the Advance due on that date. You may choose to repay via one-time debit or
        enable ongoing automatic debits. If you select automatic debits, such ongoing automatic debits will continue as
        long as you receive Advances to pay bills, until you change your payment settings, or until you otherwise revoke
        your debit authorization. You agree to maintain a balance in your Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all
        bill payments made through Advances. Failed or rejected debits may be reinitiated up to 2 additional times after
        the first debit (for a total of 3 debit attempts).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Advances are not credit and are offered on a nonrecourse basis. Consequently, neither Piermont Bank nor
        Gerald has any contractual or legal claim against you based on a failure to repay an Advance, and neither
        Piermont Bank nor Gerald will engage in debt collection activities, place the amount advanced with or sell to a
        third party, or make any reports to credit reporting agencies regarding your unpaid balances. However, we
        reserve the right to deny you access to an Advance or Services until you have paid any outstanding Advances.
        <br />
        <br />
        Gerald and Piermont Bank are not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, insufficient fund
        charges, or any other bank fees that result from your failure to maintain a sufficient balance in your Funding
        Account. Gerald monitors your balance in your Funding Account and will attempt to ensure you have sufficient
        funds before your Funding Account is debited, but Gerald and Piermont Bank make no warranties that an overdraft
        will not occur. If we detect that your Funding Account may not contain sufficient funds, Piermont Bank may avoid
        making a withdrawal from your Funding Account to repay Advances and we will notify you and may suspend or
        terminate your access to future Advances.
        <br />
        <br />

        3.4 <b class="underline"> Early Access to Wages. </b> If you receive payroll direct deposits to your Account,
        you may use up to half of your next regular direct deposit amount to pay your household bills prior to the
        deposit being made to your Account, provided that you have earned that amount. In our sole discretion, we may
        establish a maximum amount that will be made available to you through this early access feature, which maximum
        amount will be displayed to you on the App. Additional eligibility requirements for this early access feature
        may be set forth in the Account Agreement or disclosed to you on the App. <br />
        <br />
        3.5 <b class="underline"> Cash Back & Rewards</b>. You may receive up to 0.25% in cash back when you pay certain
        household bills with your Card. Gerald reserves the right to increase, decrease or waive this reward at any time
        or limit the types of household bills to which this reward applies. Additional requirements or information about
        the reward may be set forth in the App and in the Account Agreement. You can only redeem cash back and rewards
        via the bill pay feature. Cash back and rewards may be provided in the form of cash to your Account, or crypto
        or other investable assets, in our discretion. <br />
        <br />
        3.6 <b class="underline">Monthly Statements.</b> A periodic statement is generated and made available to you on
        the App on the first day of each month, covering prior month Account activity. You will be able to download and
        print copies of the statements for your records. <br />
        <br />
        3.7 <b class="underline">Chat Feature.</b> You may communicate with us in a chat feature on the App. We also may
        suspend or terminate the chat feature at any time. If you use the chat feature, you are responsible for any
        legal liability arising out of your chats. Other parties transmit messages and content over various third-party
        networks and systems and we are not responsible for the confidentiality, privacy or data security of any of your
        information or data (including personal information) or under other confidentiality, privacy or data security
        laws, rules, regulations, guidelines or obligations related to your information or data if such information or
        data is provided to a network operator or other service provider upon which the provision of the chat feature is
        dependent. <br />
        <br />
        3.8 <b class="underline">What Gerald is Not.</b> Gerald is not a money transmitter, lender, advisor, broker,
        credit repair company, or credit reporting agency. Piermont Bank (not Gerald) provides the Account, Card, and
        Advances to you, controls the funds in your Account, and effects the transfer of funds for your Account. We are
        not compensated by you or Piermont Bank for Piermont Bank for providing loans or credit to you. Our Services are
        not a replacement for professional advice or assistance regarding your finances.
        <h1 class="section__title">4. Gerald Membership Fee and Authorization for ACH Debit Entries</h1>
        In order to receive the Services, you will pay Gerald a monthly membership fee of $9.99 per month (the
        "Membership Fee"). For any month during which you pay 3 or more household bills from your Account, the
        Membership Fee for that month will be waived. If you register for your account with us in the last 10 days of a
        given calendar month, you will not be charged a Membership Fee for that month. We may add or modify fees by
        amending this Agreement as provided in Section 21 below.
        <br />
        <br />
        You must provide information on the App to link the Funding Account, a debit card, or a credit card that you
        maintain (a “Payment Method”) for the monthly payment of the Membership Fee. You will be billed for your
        Membership Fee on a monthly basis. If there is any missing or incorrect information regarding your Payment
        Method, then you authorize us to verify and correct such information.
        <br />
        <br />
        You authorize Gerald to electronically debit your Payment Method for the Membership Fee for the Membership Fee
        on a monthly basis, which debits we will attempt to sync with your first payday of each month to the extent that
        information is known to us. As applicable, you also authorize Gerald to electronically debit and credit your
        Payment Method or Funding Account, if applicable, to correct erroneous debits and credits. You have the right to
        receive notice of any debit for the Membership Fee that would vary in amount from a previous Membership Fee, but
        you agree that we only need to notify you in advance if a particular debit from your Payment Method would be
        more than $9.99. You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization contained herein represents
        your written authorization for automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) and debit card transactions as provided herein
        and will remain in full force and effect until you notify Gerald that you wish to revoke this authorization by
        emailing
        <b><a href="mailto:support@joingerald.com">support@joingerald.com</a></b
        >. Failed or rejected ACH debits may be reinitiated up to two (2) additional times after the first ACH debit
        (for a total of three (3) ACH debit attempts). <br />
        <br />

        You warrant and represent to Gerald that you have the right to authorize us to charge and credit your Payment
        Method for payments due to us under this Agreement. You represent that you are capable of saving or otherwise
        storing a copy of this electronic authorization for your records, and the credit and debit transactions you
        request comply with the Nacha Rules, if applicable, and applicable law.
        <br />
        <br />
        You agree to indemnify and hold Gerald harmless from and against any loss incurred if any of the information
        relied upon in your request to stop payment is incorrect or incomplete. You must notify Gerald at least three
        (3) business days before the scheduled debit date in order to cancel this authorization. When you call or email,
        please include the name and telephone number associated with your account with us. Failure to provide correct
        and complete information may make it impossible for Gerald to stop withdrawal of the preauthorized transaction.
        If you have followed these instructions to notify Gerald of your desire to revoke your authorization at least
        three (3) business days before the scheduled debit date, Gerald will be liable for your losses or damages
        directly caused by our failure to stop any preauthorized transaction. If we do not receive notice at least three
        (3) business days before the scheduled debit date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the
        transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so. If you revoke an authorization and
        do not replace it with another Payment Method on the App, your account will be closed and you will not be able
        to receive the Services.

        <h1 class="section__title">5. The Services Are Only Available Electronically</h1>
        The Services are only available electronically. In order for you to receive the Services, you agree to receive
        all disclosures electronically pursuant to your Consent to Electronic Disclosures which you previously agreed to
        when you opened your account and is available <b><a href="/deposit-agreement">here</a></b
        >. If, for some reason, you cannot receive communications electronically in the future, we cannot provide the
        Services to you and you should close your account.

        This Arbitration Provision sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which Claims (as defined below) may
        be arbitrated instead of litigated in court. You may choose to opt out of the Arbitration Provision, but only by
        following the process set-forth below. If you do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Provision, then you
        must notify us in writing within sixty (60) calendar days of the opening of your Account (an Account is
        considered opened on the date you first deposit funds into the Account) at the following address:

        <div class="center">
          Gerald Technologies, Inc. <br />
          245 8th Ave, #1085 <br />
          New York NY, 10011
        </div>

        Your written notice must include your name, address, Account number, Card number, or social security number, and
        a statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Provision.
        <br />
        <br />
        As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term "Claim" means any claim, dispute or controversy between you and
        us arising from or relating to the App, the Services, or this Agreement, including the validity, enforceability
        or scope of this Arbitration Provision or this Agreement. "Claim" includes claims of every kind and nature,
        including but not limited to initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims and claims based
        upon contract, tort, fraud and other intentional torts, statutes, regulations, common law and equity. The term
        "Claim" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, without limitation, any
        claim, dispute or controversy that arises from or relates to (i) use of the App, (ii) our provision and your
        receipt of the Services, (iii) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the App or
        the Services; (iv) the benefits and services related to the App or the Services; and (iv) your enrollment for
        the App and the Services. As used in the Arbitration Provision, the terms "we" and "us" shall for all purposes
        mean the Gerald Inc., and its affiliates, successors, and assigns, and all of their respective agents,
        employees, directors and representatives. In addition, "we" or "us" shall include any third party providing any
        product, service or benefit in connection with the App or the Services (including, but not limited to, third
        parties who provide services, and all of their agents, employees, directors and representatives) if, and only
        if, such third party is named as a co-party with us (or files a Claim with or against us) in connection with a
        Claim asserted by you.
        <br />
        <br />
        IF ARBITRATION IS CHOSEN BY ANY PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO
        LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM, OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED
        FOR IN THE CODE OF PROCEDURES OF THE JAMS OR AAA, AS APPLICABLE (THE "CODE"). FURTHER, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE
        RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY
        CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING.
        NOTE THAT OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
        <br />
        <br />
        If either party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis.
        There shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases
        involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other
        cardholders or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve Claims is limited to
        Claims between you and us alone, and the arbitrator’s authority to make awards is limited to you and us alone.
        Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us against you may not be joined or consolidated in
        arbitration with Claims brought by or against someone other than you, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
        all parties. We shall not elect to use arbitration under this Arbitration Provision for any Claim that you
        properly file and pursue in a small claims court of your state or municipality so long as the Claim is
        individual and pending only in that court. Claim shall be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by
        arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the code of procedures of the national arbitration
        organization to which the Claim is referred in effect at the time the Claim is filed. Claims shall be referred
        to either the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") or the American Arbitration Association
        ("AAA"), as selected by the party electing to use arbitration. If a selection by us of one of these
        organizations is unacceptable to you, you shall have the right within thirty (30) days after you receive notice
        of our election to select the other organization listed above to serve as arbitrator administrator. For a copy
        of the procedures, to file a Claim or for other information about these organizations, contact them as follows:
        (i) JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 92614; website at www.jamsadr.com; (ii) AAA at 335
        Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017; website at www.adr.org.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be
        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16, as it may be amended (the "FAA"). The
        arbitration shall be governed by the applicable Code, except that (to the extent enforceable under the FAA) this
        Arbitration Provision shall control if it is inconsistent with the applicable Code. The arbitrator shall apply
        applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and shall honor claims
        of privilege recognized at law and, at the timely request of either party, shall provide a brief written
        explanation of the basis for the decision. In conducting the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall not
        apply the Federal or any state rules of civil procedure or rules of evidence. Either party may submit a request
        to the arbitrator to expand the scope of discovery allowable under the applicable Code. The party submitting
        such a request must provide a copy to the other party, who may submit objections to the arbitrator with a copy
        of the objections provided to the request party, within fifteen (15) days of receiving the requesting party’s
        notice. The granting or denial of such request will be in the sole discretion of the arbitrator who shall notify
        the parties of his/her decision within twenty (20) days of the objecting party’s submission. The arbitrator
        shall take reasonable steps to preserve the privacy of individuals, and of business matters. Judgment upon the
        award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision will
        be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA. However, any party can appeal that
        award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization, which shall consider anew
        any aspect of the initial award objected to by the appealing party. The appealing party shall have thirty (30)
        days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award to notify the arbitration organization that it is
        exercising the right of appeal. The appeal shall be filed with the arbitration organization in the form of a
        dated writing. The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed.
        The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel which will conduct an arbitration pursuant to
        its Code and issue its decision within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of the appellant’s written
        notice. The decision of the panel shall be by majority vote and shall be final and binding.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any arbitration hearing that you attend shall take place in the federal judicial district of your primary
        residence. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of all or part of
        the filing administrative and/or hearing fees for any Claim you initiate as to which you or we seek arbitration.
        At the conclusion of the arbitration (or any appeal thereof), the arbitrator (or panel) will decide who will
        ultimately be responsible for paying the filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in connection with the
        arbitration (or appeal). If and to the extent you incur filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in
        arbitration, including for any appeal, exceeding the amount they would have been if the Claim had been brought
        in the state or federal court which is closest to your billing address and would have had jurisdiction over the
        Claim, we will reimburse you to that extent unless the arbitrator (or panel) determines that the fees were
        incurred without any substantial justification.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Arbitration Provision is binding upon and benefits you, your respective heirs, successors and assigns. This
        Arbitration Provision is binding upon and benefits us, our successors and assigns, and related third parties.
        This Arbitration Provision shall survive termination of this Agreement or your account, as well as voluntary
        payment of any debt in full by you, any legal proceeding by us to collect a debt owed by you, and any bankruptcy
        by you or us. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable under any
        principle or provision of law or equity, consistent with the FAA, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions
        of this Arbitration Provision or this Agreement, each of which shall be enforceable regardless of such
        invalidity.

        <h1 class="section__title">24. Miscellaneous</h1>
        The App is intended to and directed to residents of the United States and all advertising claims contained on
        the App are valid only in the United States. This Agreement and the resolution of any dispute related to this
        Agreement, the Services or the App will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware,
        without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Failure by Gerald to insist upon strict enforcement
        of any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. You agree that
        regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use
        of the Services or the App or this Agreement must be filed as provided above in the Arbitration Provision within
        one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. If any of these terms will be
        deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and will not affect
        the validity and enforceability of any remaining term. You may have greater rights, or some of the provisions
        may be prohibited, by virtue of state or federal consumer protection laws. In such a case, to such extent, the
        subject provisions shall not apply to you.
