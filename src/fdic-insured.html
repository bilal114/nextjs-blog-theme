          <h2 class="section__title">What is FDIC insurance for checking accounts?</h2>
          <p class="section__subtitle">
            The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a federal agency responsible for ensuring bank deposits
            of banking customers in the event of banking failures or theft. The maximum amount for an FDIC insured app
            and account is $250,000 per depositor.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, individuals may have multiple checking accounts FDIC insured spread across several banks.
            Depositors can verify banks have FDIC insurance for checking accounts by searching for the bank at FDIC.gov.

            <p class="section__subtitle">
              No. FDIC insurance for checking accounts does not cover losses caused by theft or fraud. Most banks do
              have insurance protecting them against theft and fraud called a blanket bond. Blanket bonds protect banks
              from illegal actions and/or unethical behaviour of their employees such as fraud, theft, fire, flooding,
              embezzlement, and more.
