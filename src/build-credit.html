            Interest rates may be low now, but what if they were to be raised tomorrow? Having a good credit score will
            protect the financial health of your family during times of economic uncertainty and higher interest rates.
            With a stronger credit score you will pay lower finance charges on your loans and credit cards.

            Have your eye on finally buying a newer more reliable car or a bigger house for your growing family?
            Borrowers with poor credit scores get turned down more often when applying for new loans and credit cards.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are many factors considered before loans are given, such as your debt and income levels, but having a
            good credit score is a huge step in the right direction. The better your credit score, the higher chances
            you have at being approved for new credit.

            Better approval rates is not the only benefit of having a good credit score. It also helps increase your
            borrowing limits on new loans. Helping open up new and exciting opportunities for you and your family.
            <br />
            <br />
            Banks may approve your loan even if your credit score is low, but they will limit the amount you can borrow.
            By making bill payments with a credit building app like Gerald, you are building better credit and expanding
            your future borrowing power.

          <p class="section__subtitle">
            The terms of paying back loans vary widely, and credit scores play a large role in determining loan
            repayment terms. By using apps to build credit, consumers increase their negotiating power for getting
            better loan terms. Individuals with poor credit scores are severely limited in their ability to make loan
            issuers budge on their loan terms.

          <h2 class="section__title">Better deals on car insurance</h2>
          <p class="section__subtitle">
            Auto insurance companies regularly use poor credit scores against their customers to charge them higher
            rates. They view credit reports and insurance history to develop insurance risk scores before offering car
            insurance rates, and give higher rate premiums to people with lower credit ratings.
            <br />
            <br />
            Building up your credit score with apps to help build credit can help you pay less each month for car

          <p class="section__subtitle">
            Cell phone service providers create incentives for attracting new customers with good credit scores, and
            make it difficult or more costly for customers with poor credit scores. Poor credit scores can lead to cell
            phone plans being limited to pay-as-you go plans, higher monthly payments, and security deposits.
            <br />
            <br />
            Using apps to help build credit greatly reduces the rates you may pay for cell phone service. Good credit
            scores can give consumers discounted prices on phones with cell service contracts without the need for
            security deposits.
